            "paragraph6": ":Cleaning windows on skyscraper building is very dangerous and heavy works for human.  This work must be done in only a good weather condition and it takes about a month to clean the whole tower from top to bottom.  Besides, in the Hearts Tower case (New York), it took $ 3,000,000 to build its own cleaning rig but most window cleaners left out scratches on windows glass while moving.  Then, we got a clue from Stanford’s sticky bot and carefully analyze gecko’s movement.  Currently, we are planning to develop Elder’s function as below.",
            "paragraph7": "It can run quickly on the vertical glass, concrete, rock, wood surface and react to position and path guiding by ultrasonic sound. A hall-effect sensor helps Elder predict the reliability of the surface. Then it determines to step forward or turn back. Accelerometer detects the free fall state, and then the emergency parachute is landed.",
            "paragraph8": "A flying car would have to be capable of safely taking off, flying and landing throughout urban environments; it would also require very powerful engines. In reality, many designs of fly car have suffered from problems such as easily losing stability, not being able to travel far and big noises. In the other project, we are going to build a conceptual design for a flying car - a RF controlled model, which moves sophisticatedly but powerfully.",
            "paragraph9": "I truly believe that changing the way we are using machine is changing our GENE. Making machines is making human evolution."
